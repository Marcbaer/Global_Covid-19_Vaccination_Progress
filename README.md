# Analysis of the Global Covid-19 Vaccination Progress

This Project analyzes the progress of covid vaccination in different countries by investigation the [COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress) from [Our World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).
The data is enriched with [GDP per Capita Information](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) provided by the world bank and [country population information](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/) provided by the United Nations.
The enriched data allows insights into the demographic and economic situations of the analysed countries and their progress on vaccinating their citizens.
The data is being transformed to optimize the analytical insights. The objective is to deliver insights into demographic and economic correlations of the countries in the vaccination process.

The [notebook](EDA_Covid_Vaccination.ipynb) that can be used to run the analysis is structured as followed:
* **Business Understanding**
    * Describing the situation and project goals
    * Questions to be answered


* **Data Understanding**
    * Data Access
    * Data Exploring
  
  
* **Prepare Data**
    * Reading and merging the collected datasets
        * Merge Datasets and drop unused columns
        * Drop columns with missing values
        * Transform categorical values (vaccines column) 
   
   
* **Data Modeling**: Deliver insights into the data by analysing the following points:
    * Recent Daily Vaccinations per million citizens per country
    * US Daily Vaccination Rate
    * Association between GDP per Capita and percent of vaccinated citizens
    * Association between population size and percent of vaccinated citizens
    * Regression Coefficients for population size, GDP per Capita and population density
    * Vaccines Analysis: Are there vaccines mainly accessible for countries with a high GDP per Capita?


* **Evaluation**

## Environment and Requirements

* python 3.6
* pandas 1.0.5
* numpy 1.18.5
* matplotlib 3.2.2
* seaborn 0.11.1
* sklearn 0.23.1

## How to run the analysis

The notebook [EDA_Covid_Vaccination.ipynb](EDA_Covid_Vaccination.ipynb) contains the ETL and Analysis process.

**Regression Coefficients for population size, GDP per Capita and population density**

Running a linear regression for total percentage of vaccinated citizens resulted in the following coefficients:
* **Population Size: (Negative)** -1.63475623e-06
* **GDP per Capita: (Positive)** 2.32138617e-05
* **Population Density: (Positive)** 2.81426369e-04

**Vaccines Analysis: Are there vaccines mainly accessible for countries with a high GDP per Capita?**

## Evaluation

Countries with a high GDP per Capita seem to be able to vaccinate their citizens faster than other countries. However, given the regression coefficent the population density plays an even more important role. It seems that countries with a high population density give strong effort in vaccinating their citizens as fast as possible. For countries with a total population above 100 Million, the logistics and organisational hurdles seem to slow down the process of vaccinating the citizens agains Covid-19.
Additional insights was provided by analysing the different vaccines. While Moderna is mainly used by North American and Western European countries, Sinovac and Sinopharm is popular in Asia.
